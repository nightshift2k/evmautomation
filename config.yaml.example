# WORKFLOW SPECIFIC SETTINGS
###

# every workflow starts with a name, following a configuration
# you can have multiple workflows of the same type, for 
# different wallets
#
# each workflow is identified by its key under workflows:
# and also by the workflow itself (so which logic to run)
# example: workflow: drip
#
# currently supported workflows:
# - dripfaucet
# - dripgarden
# - dripsell
# - bnbsell
# - trunkstampede

workflows:
    # DRIP faucet configuration
    my-drip-wallets:
        chain: bsc # specify which chain setup this workflow will use
        workflow: dripfaucet # the workflow that is applied
        disabled: true # self explanatory
        wallet_file: drip-wallets.json # encrypted wallet file for DRIP
        run_every_seconds: 3600 # default sleep time between checks
        wallet_bnb_min_balance: 0.01 # if set to 0 will actually still check if balance is enough for gas-fees
        hydration_max_gas: 650000 # max gas to use for hydration, if current gas fees are higher, it will be retried
        
        # the hydration count only makes sense to be used in conjunction
        # with claim_count. Using both enables to have an alternating schedule
        # for hydrating and claiming.
        # There is also an importance to use the hydration_table and claim_table
        # Basically it enables you to build up an available amount of tokens in %
        # and then hydrate it X times (hydration_count).
        # If the hydration_count is reached, the workflow will wait to reach the 
        # available amount specified by the claim_table and claim the tokens.
        # This also happens X times where X is the value specified under claim_count.
        # 
        # Example:
        # =======
        # hydration_count: 1
        # hydration_table:
        #     0: 0.01
        # claim_count: 1
        # claim_table:
        #     0: 0.01
        #
        # The above example will alternate between claiming and hydrating every time the 
        # available amount has reached 1% of your deposit.
        #
        # If only hydrating shall be run, set hydration_count to 1 and claim_count to 0
        #
